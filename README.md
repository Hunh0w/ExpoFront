# Seasoning application overview

## Brief description
	
The **goal** of the application is to **put workers in relation with employers for seasonal jobs**. It simplifies the process of looking and applying for a job.

## User stories

To access the application, you need to **create an account**, filling it with your personal information, your resume and add a profile picture.
The user **may login** to the application using his email and password.

After his profile creation, the user is able to **add references, work experiences and availability in the *Profile* tab**
The user can **search for a job** using the search home page, or can apply to **recommended offers** showed depending on his profile.

If none offers is suitable for the worker, he is also available to **talk to any employers** using the *Employer* tab.

When the worker find an offer he wants to apply to, the *Apply* clickable button redirect to the *Messages* tab and start a new message channel between the candidate and the employer.

The candidate receive a **notification** if its candidacy is updated. It can be "On hold", "Accepted" or "Rejected". If the offer is closed, the worker is notified with a message in the employer message channel with its status ("Accepted" or "Rejected").
