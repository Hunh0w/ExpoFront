# Seasoning application overview

## Brief description
	
The goal of the application is to put workers in relation with employers for seasonal jobs. It simplifies the process of looking and applying for a job.

## User stories

To access the application, you need to create an account, filling it with your personal information, your resume and add a profile picture.
The user may login to the application using his email and password.

After his profile creation, the user is able to add references, work experiences and availability 
The user can search for a job using the search home page, or can apply to recommended offers showed depending on his profile.

If none offers is suitable for the worker, he is also available to talk to any employers using the employer tab.

When the worker find an offer he wants to apply to, the "Apply" button redirect to the "Messages" tab and start a new message channel between the candidate and the employer.

The candidate receive a notification if its candidacy is updated. It can be "On hold", "Accepted" or "Rejected". If the offer is closed, the worker is notified with a message in the employer message channel.
